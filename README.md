The link to the project: https://github.com/hmkhoi2701/ThesisDefenseCommittee_OptimizationPrj/

A capstone project for the course Fundamentals of Optimization at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.  
The problem is fully stated in the file [ProjectProblem.pdf](https://github.com/hmkhoi2701/ThesisDefenseComittee_OptimizationPrj/blob/main/ProjectProblem.pdf)

In short, there are N theses and M professors. They should be divided into K committees, with some requirements
  - Number of theses and professors in each comittees should be bounded.
  - Every thesis should NOT be defended against its guiding professor
  - Similarity index between theses and professors in the same comittees should exceed a certain value
We're going to execute an input file and return a solution that maximize the similarity index for all committees.
